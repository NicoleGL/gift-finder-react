Browse the series here Review Quotes The authors explore the complex nature of leadership through different lenses, or chapters, including leadership through the leader, follower, process, performance, place, and purpose. This third edition covers new content on emerging fields such as brute capitalism, business schools, and leadership development. The authors highlight intriguing aspects such as the romance of leadership in that followers tend to exaggerate the role of leadership when things are going very well or very badly, and that being a good follower is not seen as a coveted position in the Western world.--K. Condic \"CHOICE Connect\" (12/19/2018 12:00:00 AM) This was the most helpful book I read during my entire first year as a Ph.D. student. Reading this book felt like having a good mentor nearby. --Professor Robert Strand",

    "product_description": "The French photographer Laurent Baheux dedicates his new book to the ?King of the Animals? ? the lion. Breathtaking black-and-white images create a powerful portrait of one of the most majestic and endangered species in the world. In this new photo book, Laurent Baheux journeys across Africa to capture the lion in all its intricate facets. The result is a sensitive and intimate photo portrait that shows the big cat in all its nuance: at once powerful, fragile, and tender. Baheux?s stunning black-and-white lion photographs show this feline animal with the precision and texture of a studio portrait ? its many different movements, postures, behaviours, and expressions captured with startling intimacy. Playing among the pride, out hunting its prey, or eyeing us directly from the page, Baheux?s lion photography is as much a tribute to the lion?s character, power, and feeling as it is a haunting reminder that this most impressive of animals is also among the most endangered wildlife on earth.

    "title": "In Doubt - by Simon (Hardcover)",
    "product_description": "About the Book Criminal justice is unavoidably human. Detectives, witnesses, suspects, and victims shape investigations; prosecutors, defense attorneys, jurors, and judges affect the outcome of adjudication. Simon shows how flawed investigations produce erroneous evidence and why well-meaning juries send innocent people to prison and set the guilty free. Book Synopsis The criminal justice process is unavoidably human. Police detectives, witnesses, suspects, and victims shape the course of investigations, while prosecutors, defense attorneys, jurors, and judges affect the outcome of adjudication. In this sweeping review of psychological research, Dan Simon shows how flawed investigations can produce erroneous evidence and why well-meaning juries send innocent people to prison and set the guilty free. The investigator's task is genuinely difficult and prone to bias. This often leads investigators to draw faulty conclusions, assess suspects' truthfulness incorrectly, and conduct coercive interrogations that can lead to false confessions. Eyewitnesses' identification of perpetrators and detailed recollections of criminal events rely on cognitive processes that are often mistaken and can easily be skewed by the investigative procedures used. In the courtroom, jurors and judges are ill-equipped to assess the accuracy of testimony, especially in the face of the heavy-handed rhetoric and strong emotions that crimes arouse. Simon offers an array of feasible ways to improve the accuracy of criminal investigations and trials. While the limitations of human cognition will always be an obstacle, these reforms can enhance the criminal justice system's ability to decide correctly whom to release and whom to punish. Review Quotes Dan Simon puts the criminal justice system on trial, revealing the many flaws in how it operates. In his comprehensive look at the underlying cognitive science, he highlights the many potential pitfalls that might trip up the people involved at each stage of the judicial process. Simon shows, for example, how police investigations can be skewed by biases, how interrogation techniques can promote false confessions and how eyewitnesses can wrongly identify criminal suspects. He also analyses case studies of criminal investigations, laying out rmendations for how they could be improved. Perhaps unsurprisingly, much of the book is devoted to memory, which plays a central role in criminal investigations but is also the biggest source of potential errors. Simon tells how psychologist Frederic Bartlett's work in the 1920s showed that our memories are highly error-prone, and how, more recently, cognitive psychologist Elizabeth Loftus has shown that memory can be influenced, unintentionally or otherwise, by leading questions and other techniques. If In Doubt leaves you certain of anything, it is that assessing guilt should not be left to memory alone.--Moheb Costandi \"New Scientist\" (7/21/2012 12:00:00 AM) In the past few decades, DNA evidence has starkly revealed how prone to error our criminal justice system can be, even in seemingly airtight cases. Now Dan Simon has brought the latest in psychological research to bear in order to explain some of the root causes of these disturbing failures and to point the way to solutions. This book is, by turns, terrifying, learned, and persuasive--sure to be of interest to scholars, policy-makers, and anyone concerned about the reliability of our criminal processes.--Carol Steiker, Harvard Law School Offers an intensive investigation of the psychological defects that result in false convictions and false acquittals.--W. P. Anderson \"Choice\" (12/1/2012 12:00:00 AM) Dan Simon has a superb command of the research in cognitive science, and how it affects the very real world of the criminal justice process. In Doubt shows how universal fallacies in reasoning and blind spots in perception and memory can send innocent people to prison and let guilty ones walk free, and promotes reforms to make the system more truly just.--Elizabeth Loftus, University of California, Irvine Experimental ps",

    "title": "Natural Supernaturalism - (Norton Library (Paperback)) by M H Abrams (Paperback)",
    "product_description": "About the Book The first modern study of the Romantic achievement, its origins and evolution both in theory and practice.--Stuart M. Sperry, Jr., Indiana Unviersity Book Synopsis In this remarkable new book, M. H. Abrams definitively studies the Romantic Age (1789-1835)--the age in which Shelley claimed that the literature of England has arisen as it were from a new birth. Abrams shows that the major poets of the age had in common important themes, modes of expression, and ways of feeling and imagining; that the writings of these poets were an integral part of a comprehensive intellectual tendency which manifested itself in philosophy as well as poetry, in England and in Germany; and that this tendency was causally related to drastic political and social changes of the age. But Abrams offers more than a work of scholarship, for he ranges before and after, to place the age in Western culture. he reveals what is traditional and what is revolutionary in the period, providing insights into those same two forces in the ideas of today. He shows that central Romantic ideas and forms of imagination were secularized versions of traditional theological concepts, imagery, and design, and that modern literature participates in the same process. Our comprehension of this age and of our own time is deepened by a work astonishing in its learning, vision, and humane understanding.",
